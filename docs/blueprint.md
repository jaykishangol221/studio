## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to evoke a sense of authority and reliability. The hue choice evokes the solemnity of history, without literally suggesting an 'old' or faded look.
- Background color: Crisp white (#F0F4FF) for a clean, modern interface, suitable to displaying information.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) is used for interactive elements (buttons, toggles, links) to ensure that they stand out against the primary and background colors. The saturated, vibrant choice calls users to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, will be used to give the app a clean and machined, modern look.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for the search mode toggle and any other interactive elements.
- Clean, modern layout with a focus on readability. Prioritize the AI-generated content to give the app an AI-centric focus. Ensure sufficient spacing for easy scanning and a professional look.
